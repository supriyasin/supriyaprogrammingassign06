    "\"\"\"In the following tutorial, we will understand how to create a Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator\n",
    "   with the help of the Python programming language. But we get started creating one; let us briefly \n",
    "   discuss what Body Mass Index (BMI) is.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Understanding the Body Mass Index (BMI)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   BMI, short for Body Mass Index, is a measure of relative weight based on the mass and height \n",
    "   of an individual. We generally use the Body Mass Index in order to categorize people on the \n",
    "   basis of their height and weight. These categories are underweight, healthy, overweight, and even obesity. \n",
    "   Moreover, it is also adopted by various countries in order to promote healthy eating.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   We can consider Body Mass Index (BMI) as a substitute for direct measurements of body fat. Besides, \n",
    "   BMI is a low-cost and easy-to-perform method of screening for weight classes that may cause health-related problems.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Understanding the working of BMI Calculator\n",
    "   \n",
    "   A BMI Calculator accepts the weight and height of an individual and calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of that person.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   For Example, if the height and weight of a person are 155 cm and 57 kg. The BMI of that person will be 23.73 (approx.),\n",
    "   which signifies that the person is healthy.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat on the basis of height and weight, respectively.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   On the basis of the BMI of an individual, the calculator returns a statement stating the overall health of the person.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The following table shows how the classification of BMI is done in order to identify the health status of a person.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   S. No. \tBMI \tWeight Status\n",
    "       1 \tBelow 18.5 \tUnderweight\n",
    "       2 \t18.5 - 24.9 \tNormal\n",
    "       3 \t25.0 - 29.9 \tOverweight\n",
    "       4 \t30.0 and above \tObese\n",
    "       \n",
    "  Now, let us begin coding the project.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Creating BMI Calculator using Python\n",
    "  \n",
    "  As the first step, we will create a New Python program file and name it BMI_Calculator.py. Within this file, we will \n",

    "    Explanation:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In the above snippet of code, we have defined two variables as the_height and the_weight which uses the input() \n",
    "    function to accept input from the user. We have also included the float() function outside the input() function \n",
    "    in order to convert the input string into the float data type so that we can perform calculations with it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Next, we will calculate the Body Mass Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "     We will use the following formula in order to calculate BMI.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the above snippet of code, we have defined a function for BMI using the above formula.\n",
    "We have divided the height by 100 to convert the centimeters into meters.\n",

    "In the above snippet of code, we have printed a statement stating BMI of the person.\n",
